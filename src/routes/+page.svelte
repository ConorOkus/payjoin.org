			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>
				Satoshi said that transactions with multiple inputs "necessarily reveal that their inputs
				were owned by the same owner" in the bitcoin whitepaper. For legacy bitcoin software, this
				tends to be true. As a result, you end up spending more than you have to and Surveillance
				companies use this revelation to creep on bitcoin users.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="flex flex-col text-[#F75394] flex-1">
			<h2 class="pink">The Solution</h2>
			<p>
				Payjoin joins sender and receiver inputs in the one transaction. Batching like this reduces
				fees and packs more payment activity, scaling bitcoin. Joining inputs from many owners
				breaks that assumption Satoshi warned us about. You wallet can payjoins when you spend
				without having you make any decisions. And if your wallet doesn't support it, it has a
				seamless fallback inside of <Link
					href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki"
					target="_blank">the BIP 21 unified payment standard</Link
				>.

		<h2>How to Payjoin</h2>
		<h3>Scan a Unified QR Code</h3>
		<p>
			This is a <Link href="https://bitcoinqr.dev/" target="_blank">BIP21 unified URI</Link> with a payjoin
			parameter. Even if a wallet does not support payjoin, it can still fall back to the address to
			make a successful transfer. This particular BIP21 will go to to payjoin.org‚Äôs cold wallet. By using
			payjoin, you can get a unique address for your support to keep that private. Yes, even though we
			use a cold wallet. Cool ‚ùÑÔ∏è!

		<h3>How is it private?</h3>

		<p>
			The following <a
				href="https://mempool.space/tx/58d68b22ab96b87a11c1fbd3090fee23f96f71a4115f96210ba776d0ae7d8d55"
				>transaction</a
			>
			conforms to <em>unnecessary input heuristic</em>. It contributes more inputs than are typical
			for the outputs it produces. It could be a payjoin, but we can‚Äôt know for sure.
		</p>

		<p>
			It‚Äôs normal to make transactions like this to <a
				href="https://bitcoin.design/guide/how-it-works/coin-selection/#minimize-future-fees-merge-coins"
				>minimize future fees by merging coins</a
			>. Merging coins connects their histories and hurts privacy if this is not a payjoin.
		</p>

		<p>
			By using payjoin, two parties come together to merge coins, save fees, and enhance privacy at
			the same time.
		</p>

		<code
			class="my-8 flex p-4 text-[#F75394] gap-4 rounded-xl text-xs justify-between bg-[#401D29] self-center"
		>
			<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
				<span>input 0: 198,209 sats</span>
				<span>input 1: 1,797,496 sats</span>
			</div>
			<div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-4">üîÄ</div>
			<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
				<span> output 0: 288,535 sats</span>
				<span> output 1: 1,705,291 sats</span>
			</div>
		</code>
		<p>Because of payjoin, any of the following outcomes are plausible:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc font-bold">
			<li>
				Alice had input 0 and input 1.
				<br /><span>She paid Bob output 0 and made output 1 as change</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Alice had input 0 and input 1. <br />
				<span>She paid Bob output 1 and made output 0 as change</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Bob had input 0, Alice had input 1. <br /><span
					>Bob was paid 90,326 sats to output 0, Alice took output</span
				>
				1 as change.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bob had input 0, Alice had input 1.<br /><span
					>Bob was paid 1,507,082 sats to output 1, Alice took output 0 as change.</span
				>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The possibility of that Alice and Bob may have both contributed via payjoin breaks the
			heuristic analysis used to harm bitcoin privacy. Payjoin not only makes it more difficult for
			someone looking at payjoin user history to figure out exactly how much money changed hands, it
			does so for every other transaction with many inputs and two outputs too. It looks no
			different.

		<h3>Send Payjoin</h3>
		<h3>Receive Payjoin</h3>
		<p>Sending payjoin is simple compared to lightning. It works anywhere with internet:</p>
		<p>Requesting payjoin requires a hot wallet and a public https:// or .onion server endpoint:</p>
		<ul class="list-decimal pl-4">
			<li>
				<Capsule>HTTP</Capsule> request a <Capsule>payjoin</Capsule> by sending a fallback transaction
				to the unified URI
			</li>
			<li>Sign and broadcast the payjoin transaction response</li>
			<li>Enjoy privacy and know you helped the whole network</li>
		</ul>
		<ul class="list-decimal pl-4">
			<li>
				Share a <Capsule>payjoin</Capsule> URI or QR code
			</li>
			<li>Listen for a payjoin request</li>
			<li>Respond with a payjoin proposal, having added receiver input</li>
			<li>Wait for the sender to broadcast the transaction</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Make sure your front end accepts bip21 payjoin uris. There are a huge number of reasons they
			improve your users‚Äô experience anyhow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Payjoin is a great fit for lightning nodes since they already depend on hot wallets on
			always-online servers.
